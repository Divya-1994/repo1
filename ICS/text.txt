Computer Science Computer science is one of the fastest growing career fields in modern history. It has
become one of the leading industries in the world today. Developed through the technological
architecture of electrical engineering and the computational language of mathematics, the science of 
computer technology has provided considerable recognition and financial gain for many of its well
deserving pioneers. Originally conceived as an organizational solution to the massive amounts of 
information kept on nothing more than paper, computers have evolved and advanced to become a common 
part of modern day life.It is essentially the brain of the computer and though it is the main 
determining factor in the processing power of the computer as a whole, many other parts of the machine
are just as important in overall performance. Many people don't know this and that is how computer
corporations have cheated people out of their money for so many years by selling them cheep systems
with high megahertz numbers for the processors in them. This is one reason for the success of the 
computer industry. When people find out that they have been cheated, they will try to learn more about 
the product and probably end up spending more money next time. Either way the computer companies always
win. A career in the field of computer science has been proven to be a worthwhile direction for any 
young enthusiast and this tren is looking just as bright in the new millenium. Computer science and 
technology has much to offer in anyone of its many career paths. Whether working with a large 
multinational corporation or a smaller private company on computer hardware or software in engineering
 or programming, the possibilities and opportunities are endless and are increasing everyday.
