Problem Statement : Write an algorithm EXPONENT(a, n) to find an using an appropriate method. Analyze the
asymptotic complexity of the algorithm. Write a program to implement Binary Exponent
Algorithm explained in class, time the program and analyze as explained in the instructions.
Compare your implementation with the conventional method used in EXPONENT and with
the Square-and-multiply method of exponentiation.
