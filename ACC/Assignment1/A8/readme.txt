Problem Statement : Write a program that illustrates the comparison of an ordinary Binary tree with any one of the
2-3, AVL, or Red Black trees and illustrates the specific benefits of one of the 2-3, AVL, or Red
Black trees that you have used in your implementation. Obviously for the implementation
and fairer comparison, use the same data set as input. Then, extend this program to compare
the 2-3, AVL, or Red Black trees with each other. Analyze the comparison and give concrete
conclusions.
