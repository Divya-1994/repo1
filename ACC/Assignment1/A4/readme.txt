Problem Statement : time the function you have written using the structure timeval as discussed in class/-
Write a program for Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort and Heap sort to count number
of exchanges/swaps required to sort the input data. Consider the worst case, the best
case and the average case inputs to test your program. Use the dataset generated in the
Problem #1 to serve as input data to your sorting routines to test your program.
Now repeat the same on the sorted output. Note the difference in time - in sorting an unsorted
integer vector and a sorted one. Repeat the above exercise for all the sorts. Note the time
differences.



NOTE : While compiling attached source file please ensure that input.h and input.cpp files are in the same directory. (Given in input folder)
