Problem Statement : For this program, you are to fill in the functions, writing versions of (1) insertion sort (2)
merge sort and (3) myownsort. myownsort() is a variant of the existing sorting algorithms
that is to be devised by you with an attempt to improve upon the performance of the merge
sort. Use the skeleton of the codes including here for writing your programs - filling in the
functions required. The sorting functions that you write must be modeled on the illustration
of the Bubble sort shown. Assume N is the input array that you use for evaluating the
programs.
After successfully writing and exeuting the code, answer the following questions:

2

(a) For each algorithm, how large (approximately) can N be if the sort must take no more
than 10 seconds?

(b) Can you think of a quick way to improve bubble

conclusions.
